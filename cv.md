#### About myself:

I worked as a doctor for more than 10 years but at some point of my life I realised that I want to change profession and I've decided to start learning Frontend development. I believe that I will be successful pursuing this difficult path because I'm eager to learn new things, I'm diligent and responsible person and I clearly see all the benefits that I can get with new skills.
